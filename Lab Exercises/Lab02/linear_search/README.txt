This directory provides examples of testing linear search with both Java assertions and JUnit.

Directories:

lec/
Linear search implementation with errors, and the beginning of a test class started in lecture on 2014-08-20. Will be completed in lecture on 2014-08-22.

v0_assertions_initial/
Linear search implementation with errors, and an initial set of test cases expressed using assertions (Java's assert statement).

v0_junit_initial/
Linear search implementation with errors, and an initial set of test cases expressed using JUnit.

v1_junit_complete/
Linear search correctly implemented with a for loop, and a complete set of JUnit test cases that correspond to the test case design discussed in lecture on 2014-08-20.

v2_junit_complete/
Linear search correctly implemented with a while loop, and a complete set of JUnit test cases that correspond to the test case design discussed in lecture on 2014-08-20.
